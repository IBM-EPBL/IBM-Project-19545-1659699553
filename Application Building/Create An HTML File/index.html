      <em>
          Handwritten Text Recognition is a technology that is much needed in this world as of today. This digit
          Recognition system is used to recognize the digits from different sources like emails, bank cheque,
          papers, images, etc. Before proper implementation of this technology we have relied on writing texts
          with our own hands which can result in errors. It's difficult to store and access physical data with
          efficiency. The project presents recognizing the handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the famous MNIST
          dataset. Here we will be using artificial neural networks convalution neural network.
